    <li> I first opened the website I was confused as to what I was seeing.</li>
    <li> The website uses a lot of Horizontal and vertical lines to seperate the content</li>
    <li> When I opened the site it confused me, but once I took a look around it didn't seem so bad</li>
    <li> The layout detracts from the main focus of the content because of the white background with lines going everwhere</li>
    <li> It was almost an instant load. The load time was reasonably fast</li>
    <li> The text color and size work with the layout and style of the website. The images used help understand what kind of website it is</li>
    <li> The website had links to articles, and a bar at the top that helps for navigation, Yes I think that he navigation is well done</li>
    <li> Yes the website maintaines the white background color with lines seperating the images and text within the pages</li>
    <li> Yes there is a very responsive design to the website, it's quick and keeps looking great</li>
    <li> I have learned to like the white background with the lines as a way to seperate the content, it's well done and makes this website unique</li>
    </ol>
